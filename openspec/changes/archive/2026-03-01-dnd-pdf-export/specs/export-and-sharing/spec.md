## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: PDF export of summaries
The system SHALL export session summaries as PDF documents using WeasyPrint with D&D fantasy theming. The PDF MUST include the session name, date, campaign name, and the summary content rendered with fantasy typography, decorative borders, and a parchment-toned background. The PDF MUST use Cinzel (weight 400/700) and Cinzel Decorative (weight 700) for headings and Crimson Text (regular, semibold, italic) for body text, loaded via Google Fonts. The page background MUST be a warm parchment CSS radial gradient (center `#f4e8d1` to edges `#e8d5b0`). The content area MUST have a decorative double-line border in warm gold (`#8b7335`). Ornamental unicode characters (❧, ◆, ⚜) MUST appear as side decorations along the left and right margins via CSS pseudo-elements. Summary text MUST be rendered as proper HTML `<p>` tags by splitting on double newlines, not using `white-space: pre-wrap`. The first paragraph MUST have a drop cap (first letter enlarged in Cinzel Decorative, floated left). Lines consisting of `---` or `***` in the summary text MUST be rendered as ornamental dividers. If a session has generated images, the most recent image (by `generated_at` descending from `session_images`) MUST be embedded as a full-width hero image at the top of the PDF via base64 data URI. If no images exist for the session, the hero image section MUST be omitted gracefully. Full summary PDFs MUST use a "Session Chronicle" title. POV summary PDFs MUST use "The Journal of [Character Name]" as the title. Both MUST show the session name, campaign name, and date as a subtitle.

#### Scenario: Export full session summary as PDF
- **WHEN** the DM clicks "Export PDF" on a session's full summary
- **THEN** a PDF file is downloaded with a parchment background, decorative gold borders, Cinzel headings, Crimson Text body, the title "Session Chronicle", the session name, campaign, and date as a subtitle, the summary rendered as proper paragraphs with a drop cap on the first paragraph, and a footer reading "Generated by TaleKeeper"

#### Scenario: Export a POV summary as PDF
- **WHEN** the DM clicks "Export PDF" on a specific character's POV summary
- **THEN** a PDF is downloaded with the same D&D theming, the title "The Journal of [Character Name]", the session name, campaign, and date as a subtitle, the POV narrative rendered as proper paragraphs with a drop cap, and a footer reading "As recorded by [Player Name]"

#### Scenario: PDF includes session hero image when available
- **WHEN** the DM exports any summary as PDF and the session has one or more generated images
- **THEN** the most recently generated image appears as a full-width hero image at the top of the PDF, embedded via base64 data URI

#### Scenario: PDF renders without image when none exist
- **WHEN** the DM exports a summary as PDF and the session has no generated images
- **THEN** the PDF renders normally without a hero image section, with the title appearing at the top

#### Scenario: PDF renders with fallback fonts when offline
- **WHEN** the DM exports a summary as PDF and Google Fonts is unreachable
- **THEN** the PDF renders with generic serif fallback fonts, maintaining the parchment background and decorative elements

#### Scenario: Summary text with paragraph breaks renders as styled paragraphs
- **WHEN** the summary content contains double newlines separating paragraphs
- **THEN** each paragraph is rendered as a separate `<p>` element with proper spacing, and the first paragraph has a decorative drop cap

#### Scenario: Summary text with section dividers renders ornamental dividers
- **WHEN** the summary content contains lines consisting of `---` or `***`
- **THEN** those lines are rendered as centered ornamental dividers (e.g., ─── ◆ ───) instead of plain text

### Requirement: Batch export of all POV summaries
The system SHALL allow the DM to export all POV summaries for a session in a single action, producing one PDF per character in a ZIP file. Each PDF in the batch MUST use the same D&D fantasy theming as individual POV exports, including the "The Journal of [Character Name]" title, parchment background, decorative borders, fantasy typography, drop cap, and the session's latest hero image (if available).

#### Scenario: Batch export as PDFs
- **WHEN** the DM clicks "Export All POV Summaries" for a session with 4 characters
- **THEN** a single ZIP is downloaded containing 4 PDFs, each with D&D fantasy theming, the character's journal title, and the session's latest hero image (if any), named with the character name (e.g., `thorin-pov.pdf`)
