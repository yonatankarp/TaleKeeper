## 1. Content and Image Helpers

- [x] 1.1 Add `_content_to_html(text: str) -> str` helper in `exports.py` that splits summary text on double newlines into `<p>` tags and converts `---`/`***` lines into `<div class="divider"></div>` elements
- [x] 1.2 Add `_get_latest_session_image(session_id: int) -> bytes | None` helper in `exports.py` that queries `session_images` for the most recent image by `generated_at DESC`, reads the file from disk, and returns the bytes (or `None` if no image exists or file is missing)

## 2. D&D PDF Template

- [x] 2.1 Remove the old `PDF_TEMPLATE` string constant from `exports.py`
- [x] 2.2 Add `_build_pdf_html(summary: dict, content_html: str, image_bytes: bytes | None) -> str` function that returns the full HTML document with: Google Fonts `@import` for Cinzel, Cinzel Decorative, and Crimson Text; `@page` rule with parchment radial gradient background (`#f4e8d1` center to `#e8d5b0` edges); decorative double-line gold border (`#8b7335`) on the content wrapper; unicode side ornaments (❧, ◆, ⚜) via `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements; drop cap on first paragraph via `p:first-of-type::first-letter` in Cinzel Decorative; divider styling for `.divider` elements; conditional hero image section (base64 data URI `<img>` if image_bytes provided, omitted otherwise)
- [x] 2.3 Implement POV vs. full differentiation in `_build_pdf_html`: body gets `class="pov"` or `class="full"`; POV title is "The Journal of [Character Name]" with footer "As recorded by [Player Name]"; full title is "Session Chronicle" with footer "Generated by TaleKeeper"; both show session name, campaign, and date as subtitle

## 3. Update Export Endpoints

- [x] 3.1 Update `export_pdf()` to: fetch the latest session image via `_get_latest_session_image(summary["session_id"])`; convert summary content via `_content_to_html()`; generate HTML via `_build_pdf_html()`; pass to WeasyPrint
- [x] 3.2 Update `export_all_pov()` to: fetch the latest session image once for the session; use `_content_to_html()` and `_build_pdf_html()` for each POV summary in the ZIP

## 4. Update Title and Meta Helpers

- [x] 4.1 Update `_build_title()` to return "The Journal of [Character Name]" for POV summaries and "Session Chronicle" for full summaries
- [x] 4.2 Update `_build_meta()` to return subtitle format: session name, campaign name, and date joined with ` · ` (without model info, which moves to footer or is omitted from PDF)
