# TaleKeeper

Record, transcribe, and summarize D&D sessions — entirely offline.

TaleKeeper captures audio from your game table, transcribes speech on-device using Whisper, identifies who said what via speaker diarization, and generates narrative session recaps using a local LLM. No cloud services required.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+** (for building the frontend)
- **ffmpeg** — required by pydub for audio conversion
  ```
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
- **Ollama** (optional) — for AI-powered session summaries and image generation. Install the [official macOS app](https://ollama.com/download/mac) (not Homebrew — the brew formula lacks MLX support needed for image generation).
## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd TaleKeeper

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the Python package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Build the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

This compiles the Svelte app into `src/talekeeper/static/`, which FastAPI serves automatically.

### 3. Run

```bash
talekeeper serve
```

This starts the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and opens your browser.

### 4. (Optional) Set up Ollama for summaries

```bash
ollama serve            # start the Ollama server
ollama pull llama3.1:8b # download a model
```

TaleKeeper works without Ollama — recording, transcription, and diarization all function independently. Ollama is only needed for generating session summaries.

## Docker Compose (alternative)

If you prefer not to install Python, Node.js, ffmpeg, and Ollama manually, you can run everything with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts two services:
- **talekeeper** — the app at `http://localhost:8000`
- **ollama** — the LLM backend at `http://localhost:11434`

Pull a model for summaries:

```bash
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

Data is persisted via bind-mounts (`./data/db` and `./data/audio`) and a named volume for Ollama models, so nothing is lost when containers restart.

## Image Generation

TaleKeeper can generate scene illustrations from your session content using any OpenAI-compatible image generation API. No image service is bundled — you bring your own provider.

### Supported providers

Any API that implements the OpenAI `/v1/images/generations` endpoint works, including:
- **Ollama** (local, with models like `x/flux2-klein:9b`)
- **OpenAI** (DALL-E)
- **Self-hosted** (ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion WebUI with `--api` flag, etc.)

### Configuration

Configure the image provider in the **Settings** page:
- **Base URL** — e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama or `https://api.openai.com/v1` for OpenAI
- **API Key** — if required by your provider
- **Model** — the model name your provider expects

Environment variables `IMAGE_API_KEY` and `IMAGE_MODEL` can also be used.

## Development

Run the backend and frontend dev servers in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend with auto-reload
talekeeper serve --reload --no-browser

# Terminal 2 — frontend with hot-reload
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server (port 5173) proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to the FastAPI backend (port 8000).

## CLI Options

```
talekeeper serve [OPTIONS]

  --host TEXT       Host to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --port INT        Port to bind to (default: 8000)
  --reload          Enable auto-reload for development
  --no-browser      Don't open browser on startup
```

```

## Data Storage

All data lives in the `data/` directory relative to where you run the server:

```
data/
  db/talekeeper.db    SQLite database (campaigns, transcripts, summaries)
  audio/<campaign-id>/ Recorded audio files (.webm)
  images/<session-id>/ Generated scene illustrations (.png)
```

Back up this folder to preserve your recordings and transcripts.

## Hardware Notes

- Targets Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2+) with Metal acceleration for ML workloads
- 16 GB RAM recommended for running Whisper + diarization during recording
- Smaller Whisper models (tiny, base, small) work on 8 GB machines — configurable in Settings
